#Poems by Wilfred Owen

This Corpus was collected from Project Gutenberg, where I found a book of the first revised version of Wilfred Owen's original poems. 
These poems were published posthumously after the First World War, which the author lived through and died 1 week before Armistice Day.

I collected this dataset to analyse the text and language used to discover some trends that may exist in a larger dataset of his works, and for other scholars to analyse these poems themselves.
These texts were all written by Wilfred Owen, focusing on themes related to the First World War.
Each .txt file came from a larger .txt file, which I separated into individual files related to each poem.
